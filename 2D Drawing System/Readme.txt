First, choose which polygon to control: 
"Welcome to 2D-polygons! Choose which shape you want to control: type a number between 0 to 4." 
Type an index of a shape to control.


Then, choose which algorithm you want to apply, Bresenham or DDA. 
'1' for Bresenham, '2' for DDA.

Then, decide whether to use rasterization.
Type 'y' if you want or 'n' if you donâ€™t want.

Now show the 2D polygons. Follow instruction with on screen keyboard control instead of command line.
Translation: 
	'w'---up
	's'---down
	'a'---left
	'd'---right
Rotation:
	'r'---rotate
Scaling:
	'c'---become larger in a certain rate
Stopping:
	'h'---stop all moving above but will not terminate the program.
	      Can still do other things after  'h'
Exit:
	'e'---terminate the program. The window will disappear and program 		ends.
