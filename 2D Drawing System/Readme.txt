First, choose which polygon to control: 
"Welcome to 2D-polygons! Choose which shape you want to control: type a number between 0 to 4." 
If wrong input get, it shows:
"Wrong input. Please type a number between 0 to 4." 


Then, choose which algorithm you want to us, Bresenham or DDA. 
"Now type which algorithm you want to apply: (1) Bresenham (2) DDA"
If wrong input get, it shows:
"Wrong input. Please type 1 or 2."

Then, decide whether to use rasterization.
"Choose if you want to rasterize the shape"
If wrong input get, it shows:
"Wrong input. Please type 0 or 1."

You will see the 2D polygons now. Several tips to control the shape. 
Translation: 
	'w'---up
	's'---down
	'a'---left
	'd'---right
Rotation:
	'r'---rotate
Scaling:
	'c'---become larger in a certain rate
Stopping:
	'h'---stop all moving above but will not terminate the program.
	      Can still do other things after  'h'
Exit:
	'e'---terminate the program. The window will disappear and program 		ends.
