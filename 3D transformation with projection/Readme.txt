First, you type the name of the test file. Maybe test_scene or bunny_scene.
If the file name you type is correct, you will see the window with 4 sub windows. All shape(s) has been screened. 

Then, use key to control the program. Move your curser to the screen and tap the screen to make sure your computer are taking care of the screen. 

There are 4 keys here. 'T' for Translation. 'R' for Rotation. 'S' for Scaling. 'E' to exit the program. Tap one to continue.

If there is only one shape in the test file(bunny_scene), you cannot change the shape each time cause there is no other option.

If there exists several shapes in the file(test_scene), you need to specify to index of shape first and then continue your move. The shape index is begin from 0, not 1.

Case 't':
	You need to type 3 numbers to translate in the direction of x, y, z. After that, you will see "Done and file has been updated.  ...wait for your next step..." Then, type one key to make next move.

Case 'r':
	You need to type the factor. After that, you will see "Done and file has been updated.  ...wait for your next step..." Then, type one key to make next move.

Case 's':
	You need to type 7 elements. A angle(degree, not radian), point1, and point2. So it is: angle, x1, y1, z1, x2, y2, z2. After that, you will see "Done and file has been updated.  ...wait for your next step..." Then, type one key to make next move.

Case 'e':
	If you want to exit my program, just type 'e'. The 'e' can only be called if your last call was finished completely.
